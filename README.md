My expectations for ChatGPT have always been exceptionally high from the beginning. I think it can play a vital role in my field because it can build 3D models for me, analyze complex data, and solve problems I can't.   ChatGPT   possesses potential to revolutionize my profession by making repetitive work efficient,   automating tasks, and   augmenting   analytical   power.   It could be pretty helpful for my future study.
ChatGPT could be a pretty helpful assistant for engineers. “The language comprehension in ChatGPT means engineers can jot down a few notes as part of their debrief and the AI can use the content to generate a report, for example, adds Jain. This means engineers can automate the mundane work, such as writing and summarizing what they’ve just done when they complete a job, and generate a report quickly and easily”.[1] What’s more, “It can help organizations capture and organize the unstructured knowledge, experience of the experienced workforce and make it accessible in a format that is desirable for the next generation of workers,” which is really useful. According to a study by Xu et al. (2023), AI-driven tools like ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into engineering workflows to support decision-making and predictive modeling, particularly in areas like computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) [2].
One specific application of ChatGPT in mechanical engineering is o代 写mechanical engineeringPython
代做程序编程语言ptimizing electric vehicle (EV) battery thermal management systems. Engineers designing EVs need to ensure that the battery pack maintains an optimal temperature to maximize efficiency and lifespan. ChatGPT can assist in this process by quickly generating MATLAB or Python scripts for thermal simulations, suggesting material properties for heat dissipation, and even refining cooling system designs based on computational results. A case study by Zhao et al. (2023) demonstrated how AI-assisted simulation tools helped reduce thermal runaway risks in EV batteries by identifying optimal cooling pathways [3]. This enhances the engineering workflow by accelerating the iterative design process and improving the reliability of EV systems.
